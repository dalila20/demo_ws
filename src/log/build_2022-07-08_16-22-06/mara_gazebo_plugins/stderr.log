  By not providing "Findhrim_actuator_rotaryservo_msgs.cmake" in

  configuration file provided by "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_msgs", but CMake
  did not find one.

    hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_msgs" to

  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
