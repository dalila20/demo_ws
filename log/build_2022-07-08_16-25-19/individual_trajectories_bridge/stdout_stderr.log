CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findhrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions" with any of the following names:

    hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actionsConfig.cmake
    hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "hrim_actuator_rotaryservo_actions" provides a separate development package
  or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
