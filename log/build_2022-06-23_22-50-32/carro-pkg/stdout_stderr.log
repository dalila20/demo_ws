CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find[deps].cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "[deps]", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "[deps]" with any
  of the following names:

    [deps]Config.cmake
    [deps]-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "[deps]" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "[deps]_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "[deps]"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
